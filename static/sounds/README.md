# Sound Effects for AI DungeonMaster

This directory contains sound effects used by the AI DungeonMaster application.

## Required Sound Files

The following sound files are referenced by the application:

1. `click.mp3` - A subtle click sound for button interactions
2. `success.mp3` - A positive sound for successful actions
3. `ambient.mp3` - Background ambient music for the adventure
4. `error.mp3` - An alert sound for errors or warnings

## Adding Custom Sounds

You can replace these files with your own custom sounds to personalize the experience. Make sure to:

1. Keep the same filenames
2. Use MP3 format for best browser compatibility
3. Keep file sizes small for faster loading
4. Consider volume levels - ambient sounds should be quieter than effect sounds

## Sound Credits

When adding sounds, ensure you have the proper rights to use them. Free sound resources include:

- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
- [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/)
- [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/)

## Placeholder Files

If you don't have sound files yet, you can create empty or minimal MP3 files as placeholders to prevent 404 errors in the browser console.
